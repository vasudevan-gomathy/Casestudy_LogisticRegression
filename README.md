# CaseStudy_LogisticRegression

## Summary:

This Case Study involves analysing the dataset and finding the relationship between dependent variable and independent variable using Logistics Regression.

Itâ€™s a classification algorithm that is used where the target variable is of categorical nature. The main objective behind Logistic Regression is to determine the relationship between features and the probability of a particular outcome.

Logistic Regression is a popular algorithm as it converts the values of the log of odds which can range from -inf to +inf to a range between 0 and 1.
Since logistic functions output the probability of occurrence of an event, they can be applied to many real-life scenarios therefore these models are very popular.


## About the Dataset:

This dataset contains information of users in a social network. Those informations are the user id the gender the age and the estimated salary. A car company has just launched their brand new luxury SUV. And we're trying to see which of these users of the social network are going to buy this brand new SUV And the last column here tells If yes or no the user bought this SUV we are going to build a model that is going to predict if a user is going to buy or not the SUV based on two variables which are going to be the age and the estimated salary. So our matrix of feature is only going to be these two columns. We want to find some correlations between the age and the estimated salary of a user and his decision to purchase yes or no the SUV.


## Evaluation of the Model:
